# Project: Hosting an IIS Web Server on an Azure VM

## ðŸ§­ Overview

In this project, I deployed a Windows Server 2022 VM in Microsoft Azure, installed IIS, configured the appropriate Network Security Group (NSG) rules, and verified access to the web server using both Telnet and curl. This project reinforced core Azure VM management, networking, and basic web hosting fundamentals.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Services Used

- Azure Portal
- Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (D2s_v3)
- IIS (Web Server role)
- Azure NSG rules
- PowerShell & Command Prompt
- Telnet
- curl

---

## ðŸªœ Key Steps

1. Created a new Windows Server VM using the Azure Portal
2. Installed IIS via Server Manager
3. Opened TCP port 80 using Azure NSG inbound rule
4. Verified local web service using `http://localhost`
5. Confirmed external connectivity with:
   - `telnet <public-IP> 80`
   - Manual `GET / HTTP/1.1` request
   - `curl http://<public-IP>` from a second system

- [ ] Azure VM configuration (size, OS)
- [ ] NSG showing port 80 allowed
- [ ] IIS default page in browser
- [ ] Telnet session returning HTTP 200 OK
- [ ] curl response showing HTML content

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How Azure's NSG rules interact with Windows Defender Firewall
- How to use Telnet and curl to manually validate web server availability
- Basics of serving content from IIS and understanding HTTP headers

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Add a custom HTML page to the IIS root
- Enable HTTPS with a self-signed certificate
- Deploy a similar setup using automation (PowerShell or ARM templates)
