# Azure VM Backup and Disaster Recovery Lab

## Overview

This lab demonstrates how to configure Azure Backup for a Windows Server VM acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller (AD/DC). The goal was to implement a basic disaster recovery strategy using Azure Recovery Services Vault and simulate the restore process.

---

## ‚úÖ Lab Tasks Completed

1. **Created Recovery Services Vault** (`NoggLabRecoveryVault`)
2. **Enabled backup** for `WinTestD2VM01` (Windows Server Domain Controller)
3. Applied a **Standard Backup Policy** with 30-day retention
4. **Initiated a manual backup**
5. Verified backup status via the **Backup Jobs** page
6. Simulated a **VM restore preview** using the most recent restore point

## üß† Concepts Demonstrated

- Azure Backup architecture and vault setup
- Standard vs Enhanced policies
- Application-consistent restore points
- Safe, non-disruptive restore simulation
- Real-world relevance for enterprise disaster recovery

---

## üîí Why This Matters

Backing up Active Directory domain controllers ensures minimal downtime and protects identity infrastructure. Azure's incremental backup system offers secure, cost-effective disaster recovery‚Äîeven for small environments like this lab.
