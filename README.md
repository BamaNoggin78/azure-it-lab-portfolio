# Daniel Watts – Azure & Windows Server Lab Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an IT professional with a strong background in troubleshooting, desktop support, and systems administration. I'm currently developing and improving my skills in Azure and Windows Server as I prepare for the AZ-104 certification.

This portfolio is both a hands-on learning log and a showcase of what I’ve configured and tested. From spinning up VMs and storage in Azure, to building Windows Server environments with IIS, SMB shares, and Active Directory — this is where I document what I’ve done and what I’ve learned.

💡 I'm passionate not just about solving technical problems, but about doing so in a way that’s clear, people-focused, and practical for real users and teams.
